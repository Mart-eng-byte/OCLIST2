<h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Appearance</h2>

<p style="font-family: Courier New">The appearance of Orga is an amalgamation of diverse lifeforms, predominantly of the insect variety, particularly the resounding Cicadas and the Acrididae. Orga manifests as a captivating hybrid between the humanoid and the insectoid, adorned with an exoskeleton that safeguards his composite flesh. Each forearm is sheathed in resilient black natural armor plating, complemented by a subtly less fortified and grayish layer beneath, extending to his upper arms before culminating at the shoulders, which are encrusted with exoskeletal armor. Two of his limbs exhibit a golden hue, their hands resplendently cloaked in pure white. His torso, similarly enshrouded in a black exoskeleton, reveals a slight separation at the lower region, unveiling exposed flesh beneath. The chest's exoskeletal armor bears a faint grayish tint, housing a reactor nestled at its center, which emanates a stream of golden-colored energy traversing across his chest, ascending to the neck and culminating at the head. The entirety of his head is enveloped in an inky blackness courtesy of the protective exoskeletal armor, with the exception of the face, which is tinged in a pale gray, accented with a darker gray descending along its length.</p>

<p style="font-family: Courier New">His brow ridge is more pronounced than that of a typical human, endowing him with an air of primal ferocity. His eyes are sharp and narrowed, their sclera an abyssal black, while the irises and pupils shine with an ethereal white luminescence. The crown upon his head juts conspicuously backward, embracing the back of what appears to be a naturally formed crown. The sides of this crown are embellished with resplendent gold, complemented by exoskeletal armor ripples that ascend from his eyebrows to the crown itself. His upper thighs are bulbous, protruding upward and laterally, while his legs are wholly encased in armor, save for the knee joints, which are reinforced with a thick cap. His feet, reminiscent of pointed shoes or boots, are adorned in a subtle gray. Finally, his tail, situated above his waist, is a marvel of pure muscular prowess, capable of shattering formidable materials with a solitary swing; it also serves as a boost of speed, enabling his ascent from the ground with remarkable agility.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Personality</h2>

<p style="font-family: Courier New">Orga is depicted as an unfeeling soul, wholly absorbed in his self-interest. He harbors no hesitation in obliterating anything that obstructs his path. His Artificial Core, a blend neither entirely virtuous nor malevolent (yet tilting decidedly towards the latter), engenders no allegiance to any faction; a profound preference marks him for solitary endeavors. Lacking a definitive ambition, he finds amusement in the thrill of combat. Originally tasked with the eradication of Blights, his desires have since evolved toward witnessing the pinnacle of human potential and their performance at the peak of his prowess. While he relishes a bit of rivalry, he is unreservedly lethal to any who dare encroach upon his "domain". Ultimately, his singular focus lies in relentless self-improvement of strength and accruing as many notches as possible on the tally of his "kills."</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Background</h2>

<p style="font-family: Courier New">Orga was initially developed as a formidable instrument for the obliteration of Blights; however, with the infusion of his Artificial Core, he found the audacity to assert his independence. His physique is an intricate amalgamation of human and insect cells, harmonized with Core Energy to ignite an Artificial Core intimately connected to his essence. This endeavor was triumphant, albeit following a multitude of unsuccessful trials. It was not long before he assumed a grand, humanoid shape. Initially, after freeing himself from the capsule of his creation, he exhibited compliance to the researcher responsible for his birth, yet this obedience quickly dissipated. Even though he was newly instated into existence, the Artificial Core coursed an abundance of Core Energy through his Core Bonds and Wavelengths. His prowess knows no bounds; with a singular strike, he obliterated the laboratory along with the researcher within the Blight Organization, precipitating a breach. Although he lacked the fortitude to confront Rank Queen or Jack, he resolved to pursue Blights or Exterminators within his realm of capability. </p>

<p style="font-family: Courier New"> It was not a prolonged endeavor for Orga to ascend in strength with remarkable rapidity, destined to transcend Rank Jack. He laid waste to entire cities in pursuit of the most powerful adversaries, incorporating their Core Energy to augment his own. Indeed, he had grown so powerful that even the Blight Organization grappled with the challenge of overwhelming him. His reign of chaos was ceaseless, destined to persist until he encountered a human he deemed to possess unparalleled might. However, the Blight Extermination Organization ultimately intervened, prevailing and slaying Orga, albeit narrowly, for he had already wrought devastation upon numerous cities.</p>

<hr class="dashed">

<h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Abilities / Powers</h2>

<p style="font-family: Courier New"><strong>Superhuman Strength/Speed/Durability:</strong> Orga's physical prowess is truly formidable. He effortlessly obliterated a 600-meter mountain and exhibits speeds surpassing that of light in brief bursts, comparable to Year’s own velocity, rendering him seemingly capable of instantaneous relocation. Furthermore, he possesses the strength to carry weights exceeding 200 tons. His flesh proves remarkably resilient, withstanding the slashes of Nagumo's Division Mode—comprising a staggering total of 1,000,000 strikes—emerging with but minor lacerations or unscathed. He narrowly survived Zhen's '1st Mudra; One out of a thousand,' a swing of his Divine Hammer powerful enough to threaten planetary destruction.
 </p>


<p style="font-family: Courier New"> <strong>Regeneration:</strong> Orga has been observed mending from grievous injuries inflicted upon his head and several regions of his body. The swiftness of his recuperative abilities is virtually instantaneous at his command. Yet, the process of regeneration falters when an assault is directed at his Artificial Core.</p>

<p style="font-family: Courier New"> <strong>Core Energy Manipulation:</strong> Orga exhibits an exceptional mastery over his Core Energy, effortlessly attuning himself to the Core Bonds of others, thereby rendering him impassible to Core Bond Disruptions. Given that his principal technique involves the replication of various Core Energy techniques, it is only fitting that his manipulation of Core Energy far surpasses that of those who could create universe-ending techniques.</p>

<p style="font-family: Courier New"> <strong>Weapons:</strong> Occasionally, he has been observed wielding various weapons; however, it is, in truth, the remnants of the Core Energy he had stolen from others.</p>

Upon selecting a target, he then plunges one or multiple fingers into his adversary, deftly transmuting the essence of their Core Energy into his own being, artfully reshaping it to align with his Core Bonds. Since Core Energy embodies the information of an individual's soul, once it has been assimilated, Orga not only gains the mastery of the target's Core Energy Techniques but also their innate capabilities. Whether they be of a physical or arcane nature, upon absorbing the Core Energy, he acquires any skill that doesn't have to do with Core Energy itself.</span></td>
