<h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Appearance</h2>

<p style="font-family: Courier New">Nagumo's appearance varies from time to time, he could have his hair tied in a different way, have different clothes but one detail that makes him quite distinguishable is his Okina Noh Mask. Nagumo usually wears a yukata with various patterns sewn into it. He prefers really loose clothes as it feels comfortable to him. Nagumo himself has long black hair that stretches down to his rear, though it's usually tied up into a large ponytail or bun. His face is always kept hidden with his mask, which is beige in color with a very long beard that comes down quarter down his torso. Beneath his attire lies a physique that is both slender and exquisitely toned. Although his true face is the embodiment of striking allure, with eyes shimmering like polished titanium, he steadfastly chooses to wear the mask at all times.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Personality</h2>

<p style="font-family: Courier New">Nagumo is usually playful and quite childish, however he does most of the time express his calm and composed nature. He's not always serious but he sure doesn't want to miss a single detail, he's very observant at times and stores whatever important information gathered in his head.With his cheerful demeanor, he navigates most situations with grace, seldom allowing trivial matters to perturb his composure. However, as one seasoned in the arts of combat, he exhibits a certain severity towards those who falter, a reflection of the tragic demise of his former companion—an unfortunate misstep on his part. He has been known to take delight in playfully toying with those beneath his ranks. In the arena of battle, he remains ever vigilant, refusing to underestimate his adversaries, regardless of their perceived power; he is not easily deceived, though, on occasion, he may act cocky, leading him to toy with his opponents.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Background</h2>

<p style="font-family: Courier New"> Nagumo possesses the blood of the Hinomaru clan, a family renowned for its formidable swordsmen. This family employs unique techniques known solely to its members. It was not long before he and his friend, whom he had personally instructed in the art of swordsmanship, uncovered the existence of the Blight Extermination Organization. To Nagumo, life is deemed rather mundane; nevertheless, he has confronted a Blight at a grave site, lamenting the loss of a cherished one. While he felt an exhilarating urge to vanquish it and showcase his prowess, he was, to his dismay, let down by the Blight's disappointing power. Following several days spent on entrance examinations alongside his comrade, a catastrophic and unforeseen calamity befell them, tragically resulting in the demise of his companion through a grievous blunder in regard to fighting a powerful Blight. In the aftermath of these events, he finds himself consumed by ire towards mistakes and failures, resolute in his desire to prevent further loss of life.</p>

<p style="font-family: Courier New"> His keenly perceptive nature and composed self, facilitated his swift ascent through the ranks, complemented by the history of the art of swordsmanship. Throughout his esteemed tenure as a Blight Exterminator, he deftly vanquished over a thousand Blights with his blade. Although he rarely partakes in training, his prowess has now reached the exalted heights of the Queen's ranks. </p>

<h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Abilities / Powers</h2>

<p style="font-family: Courier New">Superhuman Strength/Speed/Durability: His extreme level of skill on swordplay is what makes him dangerous, there were times that even with a dull blade was he able to cut through solid and tough material easily without straining himself. He makes such precise cuts that even surgeons would be jealous. And his strength and speed is nothing to scoff at, at short bursts, he could move faster than light itself which could possibly disorientate his adversaries and blitz them with countless attacks in one go. With his strength, he is able to carry of about 20 tons of weight on each hand without struggling and could force a swing with his sword if it either blocked or grabbed. And with "natural" durability / endurance without Core Energy in use, he is able to tank 40 tons of weight crashing onto him. With these stats, they could also be amplified with Core Energy, making him even stronger than before.</p>

<p style="font-family: Courier New"> Weapons: Nagumo's weapon is his singular katana that he always carries by his side. Though it is slightly chipped now, he could still do a number on his opponents well and it is sole source of power for his 100-sword style.</p>

As the blade hovers, a cascade of duplicates descends, becoming nestled in the earth around him. The quantity of blades is contingent solely upon Nagumo's volition, potentially extending to a staggering 10,000 swords. Nevertheless, this technique serves primarily as a prelude for his more formidable maneuvers and assaults. By employing this method, he establishes the area as his own domain. Should anyone attempt to extract one of these blades, they will be met with immediate rejection, rendered incapable of drawing any sword from the ground.</span></td>

Once applied, the sword's blades would be covered in Core Energy which would take on a light reddish hue. With the blade, he would strike his opponent with either the dull or sharp side of the blade. Either side will cause excruciating pain and anguish as well as having the blade be stuck onto the opponent's body. As none but himself could extract the sword, the opponent has no choice but to accept having a sword embedded into them. He only so chooses to use the dull side of his blade when he's sparring or whenever he's trying to knock people out. With the sharp side however, it is fatal when applied with Division mode.</span></td>

With a singular, decisive strike, Nagumo advances upon his opponent, striking his weapon against at least one sword that has already pierced the foe's flesh, all the while imbued with Core Energy, this time taking on a blue hue. Upon the collision of these two blades, an intense wave of Core Energy surges forth, creating a chain reaction to the remaining swords. Thus, each blade adorning the adversary's body shall erupt into power bursts of Core Energy, cleaving the opponent into segments equivalent to the number of swords raised to the power of that same number (Should the quantity of blades upon the target be four, it results in an astonishing 256 severed slices).  </span></td>
